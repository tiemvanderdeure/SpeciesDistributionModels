    sdm(presences, absences; models, [resampler], [predictors], [verbosity])

Construct an ensemble with input data specified in `presences` and `absences`.

The first input argument is species presences and the second (pseudo-)absences. Both presence and absence data must be Tables-compatible (e.g., a `DataFrame`, a `Vector` of `NamedTuple`, but not an `Array`)

## Keywords
`models`: a `Vector` of the models to be used in the ensemble. All models must be MLJ-supported Classifiers. 
For a full list of supported models, see https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/MLJ.jl/stable/model_browser/#Classification
`resampler`: The resampling strategy to be used of type `MLJBase.ResamplingStrategy`. Defaults to 5-fold cross validation.
`predictors`: a `Vector` of `Symbols` with the names of the predictor values to be used. By default, all pdf
`verbosity`: an `Int` value that regulates how much information is printed.
`cache`: is passed to `MLJBase.machine`. Specify cache=false to prioritize memory management over speed.
`scitype_check_level`: is passed to `MLJBase.machine`. Specify scitype_check_level=0 to disable scitype checking.

"""
    evaluate(x; measures, train = true, test = true, [validation])

Evaluate `x`, which could be a SDMmachine, SDMgroup, or SDMensemble, 
by applying the measures provided to the data used to built an ensemble, 
and return an evaluation object.

## Keywords
- `measures` is a `NamedTuple` of measures. The keys are used to identify the measures.
This defaults to using auc, log_loss, and kappa.
For threshold-dependent measures, the highest score as well as the threshold at which the highest scores is reached are reported.
A list of measurse is available here: https://juliaai.github.io/StatisticalMeasures.jl/dev/auto_generated_list_of_measures/#aliases. However, note that not all measures are useful.
- `train`: a `Bool` that indicates whether to evaluate on the training data. Defaults to `true`
- `test`: a `Bool` that indicates whether to evaluate on the test data.Defaults to `true`
- `validation`: optionally, provide a separate validation dataset. 
Data should be provided as a `Tuple` with presences as the first field and absences as the second.

"""
    explain(ensemble::SDMensemble; method, [data], [predictors])

Generate response curves for `ensemble`.

## Keywords
- `method` is the algorithm to use. See ShapleyValues
- `data` is the data to use to generate response curves, and defaults to the data used to train the ensemble
- `predictors`: which predictors to generate response curves for. Defaults to all variables in `data`.

"""
    predict(SDMobject, newdata; clamp = false, threaded = true, [reducer], [by_group])

Use an `SDMmachine`, `SDMgroup`, or `SDMensemble` to predict habitat suitability for some data, optionally summarized for the entire ensemble, or for each `SDMgroup`.

`newdata` can be either a `RasterStack`, or a Tables.jl.compatible object. It must have all predictor variables used to train the models in its columns (or layers in case of a RasterStack).

## Keywords
- `clamp`: if `true`, the predictions are clamped to the interval seen during training of `SDMobject`. Defaults to `false`
- `threaded`: if `true`, run multithreaded. Defaults to `true`.
- `reducer`: Optionally provide a `Function` to summarize the output. The function should take an vector of values and return a single value. Typical examples are `Statistics.mean` or `Statistics.median`.
- `by_group` is set to `true`, the data is reduced for each `SDMgroup`, if it is set to `false` (the default), it reduced across the entire ensemble.

## Returns
If `newdata` is a `RasterStack`, the `predict` returns a `Raster`; otherwise, it returns a `NamedTuple` of `Vectors`, with 
habitat suitability represented by a floating-point number between 0 and 1.
